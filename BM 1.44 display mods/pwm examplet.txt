PWM example

Arduino Nano 33 IOT has 7 dedicated pins that can also be used as digital I/O pin such as (D2, D3, D5, D6, D7) and also 2 analog pins (A2 and A3) that can be analog I/O or used as PWM.

int pwmPin = 6;

void setup() {
  pinMode(pwmPin, OUTPUT);
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  for (int i=0; i<255; i=100) {
    analogWrite(pwmPin, i);
    //delay(100);
    // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  }

}
